# Creating standalone Desktop Applications with React, Electron and SQLite3

Working with local databases together with Electron is a challenging task in many ways.
I've done the job in this repo for anyone to use and build upon.

The CRUD example in this template is a rewrite of my [Contacts-App](https://github.com/iohan/Contacts-app) but instead of Next.js and Prisma, I'm using React and SQLite.
Hope you find it usefull!

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
# At the project root, run:
yarn
```

Then, run the development server

```bash
# At the project root, run:
yarn dev
```

To package and test

```bash
# At the project root, run:
yarn pack-app
```

To package and build for distribution

```bash
